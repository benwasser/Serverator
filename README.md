Ace-based frontend/Node.js editor and manager 

This is an older project of mine that I've used pretty extensively to do rapid development. It's a code editor and Node.js app manager with auto-restart and restart-on-changes functions. I can't really grasp everything that I was doing when I wrote it, so I haven't been able to devote too much time to improvements.
